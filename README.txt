This is Acme Endeavours, which help the user to assign duties and also make anonymous shouts.

Acme Endeavours evaluates duties which can stablish a date for the start of a duty and the end
of a duty.But you can end a duty before the end of the duty.

To create a duty as a officer the dates must be provided like year/month/day hour:minute if the service is used in english.
Para crear un deber como oficial las fechas deben ser introducidas día/mes/año hora:minutos si el servicio se usa en español.
